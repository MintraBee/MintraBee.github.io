In short, Iterators are methods that are supported by collections.  Things that are stored in a group of data members are called collections such as array and hashes.  Iterate literary means doing one thing multiple times.  We often refers this to the constantly loops.  Ruby interators will return all of the elements of a collection of after another.  

It is important to learn about Iteration to increase the productity and create less work for one self.  For example, the most common iterator used are: 
     
		 Each Iterator returns all elements of an array or hash. 

             Collection.each do |variablename|
                   #codetobeiterate
             End

     Collect iterator returns all elemtns of a collection.  

            Collection = collection.collect
     
		 Times Iterator create a loops for a specific number of time.
		    
				    t.times do |variable_name|
						  #codetobeiterate
					  End
	

It is important to understand what each of them returns to use them effectively and properly.  There are many more methods that I have not mentioned in that could be use.   Other Iterator that freequent use are .select, .delete, .find etc.  

Iterators is an object that allows to iterate over the data set.  You will need to use external objects to use loops whereas in iterations, the colletion uses itself to do this.
