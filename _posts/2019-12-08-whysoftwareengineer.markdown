I have always been interested in coding but never seriously pursue it due to not having confident that I was smart enough.  I have always hold myself back from trying it out but I have never stop being curious about it.  My mother's death last year had a big impact on me, I started going into depressiong and had self-doubt about everything.  As a way of getting myself out of that situation, I wrote a list of things that I am determine to do by the end of the year.  Coding was one of those things.  I started off with HTML/CSS, and from then on I started picking up different programming languages.  

The most important thing about coding is that it make me feel empowered.  I always think you have to be good at math to be a good coder.  While this is not necessary wrong but it is not true as well.  Anyone could learn to code with patience and diligent.  It take alot of troubleshooting and determination.  I remember picking up a html course and thinking that I will definitely fail this.  At the end of the class, I love it more than anything.  I ended up spending hours on my website and playing with my code to see what it does.  I think it is easy to doubt yourself when you're doing something that is unfamilar and new.  That was how coding was for me.  I am thankful to all my peers and teacher who encourage me and guide me to help make coding so much more fun.  

After I learned that I enjoyed coding, I started teaching kids how to code using beginner level python coding game.  I also teaches robotics on the side.  It is so much fun learning along my students.  I work hard to encourage many girls in STEM programs and try to have a 50/50ration of girl and boy students in my classes.  I want to make sure that girl of low income house hold can equally get the same opportunity as any other.  I find it rewarding to see how all my student grow.   

Though I am early into my coding career, I've already learned so much.  I know my mother would have been proud of me and I know I am proud of myself.  Just like my mother use to tell me, "it does not matter how slow you go, as long as you don't stop."  As long as you're coding, you will always get stuck on something and it's okay.  Take your time to learn it, understand your code.  You might be able to solve it, you might not but no matter what you do, don't ever stop.
